Main files: model_toy.xml, TranslationSBMLgenerator.py
 
TranslationSBMLgenerator.py creates SBML file model_toy.xml with few reactions
It is just a toy example. The full model SBML is too large to load.
To create a full model uncomment the last line and comment out the line before last.



Some notes on SBML ID naming:
Translation initiation reactions IDs end up  with Init.  Ex.: MG_015_MONOMER_Transl_Init
Elongation reactions IDs include 'plus' in the name, eg MG_001_MONOMER_p9_plus_L3
